# Cyrill Browsing Extension

Firefox extension enhancing http://cyril.psalterium.cz/
with keyboard navigation.
(Works only on the [page detail view](http://cyril.psalterium.cz/nahled.php?id=1).)

* left arrow key - go to the previous page
* right arrow key - go to the next page
* up arrow key - go to the year's contents

This extension has only been published as source on Github,
as the expected audience is extremely small.
Created mainly for myself as a productivity hack while
working on a thesis which requires browsing the site a lot.
